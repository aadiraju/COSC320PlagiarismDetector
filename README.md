# COSC 320:  Plagiarism Detector
## About
Plagiarism Detector made for COSC320 using KMP, LCSS, and Rabin-Karp String matching algorithms.

### File Information
- `g17_corpusfinal/` contains all of the files in the dataset that we are using for this project. All files are in `.txt` file format.
- `COSC320ThirdMilestone.ipynb` contains the impleentation of our Naive Plagiarism Detection Algorithm for milestone 3 as well as the code we used to test and graph our algorithm's runtime.
- `COSC320FinalMilestone.ipynb` contains the impleentation of our "Optimized" Plagiarism Detection Algorithm for the final milestone as well as the code we used to test and graph our algorithm's runtime.

## How to Run
To run, simply clone the repository, and open `COSC320ThirdMilestone.ipynb` for milestone 3, and `COSC320FinalMilestone.ipynb` for the final milestone in a Jupyter-compatible environment.
